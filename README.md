**ðŸŒŸ What Awaits You? Why C?ðŸŒŸ**

Inside these virtual walls, you'll find a collection of C code and complete notes + some quirky insights. They say C is the language that all others bow down to, and I couldn't agree more. 

I've got a wide array of topics, from the basics to the advanced stuff, guiding you through everything. 

If you're a coding beginner or a coding champ, you're in for a treat as we dive deep into the intricacies of C. Let's go!

**How to study:** 

I have labelled the beginner topics, intermediate topics, and advanced topics, those are the main ones. The rest, you'll find out as you go.
