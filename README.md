**ðŸŒŸ What Awaits You? Why C?ðŸŒŸ**

Inside these virtual walls, you'll find a collection of C code and complete notes + some quirky insights. They say C is the language that all others bow down to, and I couldn't agree more. 

I've got a wide array of topics, from the basics to the advanced stuff, guiding you through everything.
